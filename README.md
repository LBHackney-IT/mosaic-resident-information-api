# Mosaic Resident Information API

Mosaic resident information API allows services to retrieve information from Mosaic
This API hold two GET endpoint one to retrieve all resident record from mosaic and one to retrieve record for a specified ID

## Stack

- .NET Core as a web framework.
- nUnit as a test framework.

## Dependencies

## Contributing

### Setup

1. Install [Docker][docker-download].
2. Install [AWS CLI][AWS-CLI].
3. Clone this repository.
4. Rename the initial template.
5. Open it in your IDE.

### Development

To serve the application, run it using your IDE of choice, we use Visual Studio CE and JetBrains Rider on Mac.

The application can also be served locally using docker:
1.  Add you security credentials to AWS CLI.
```sh
$ aws configure
```
2. Log into AWS ECR.
```sh
$ aws ecr get-login --no-include-email
```
3. Build and serve the application. It will be available in the port 3000.
```sh
$ make build && make serve
```

### Release process

We use a pull request workflow, where changes are made on a branch and approved by one or more other maintainers before the developer can merge into `master` branch.

![Circle CI Workflow Example](docs/circle_ci_workflow.png)

Then we have an automated six step deployment process, which runs in CircleCI.

1. Automated tests (nUnit) are run to ensure the release is of good quality.
2. The application is deployed to development automatically, where we check our latest changes work well.
3. We manually confirm a staging deployment in the CircleCI workflow once we're happy with our changes in development.
4. The application is deployed to staging.
5. We manually confirm a production deployment in the CircleCI workflow once we're happy with our changes in staging.
6. The application is deployed to production.

Our staging and production environments are hosted by AWS. For staging, we deploy to StagingAPIs and for production, we deploy to the Mosaic-Production AWS account. Merges into `master` deploy to staging and production, see [CircleCI config](./.circleci/config.yml).

## Testing

### Run the tests

```sh
$ make test
```

To run database tests locally (e.g. via Visual Studio) the `CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable will need to be populated with:

`Host=localhost;Database=entitycore;Username=postgres;Password=mypassword"`

Note: The Host name needs to be the name of the stub database docker-compose service, in order to run tests via Docker.

### Agreed Testing Approach
- Use nUnit, FluentAssertions and Moq
- Always follow a TDD approach
- Tests should be independent of each other
- Gateway tests should interact with a real test instance of the database
- Test coverage should never go down
- All use cases should be covered by E2E tests
- Optimise when test run speed starts to hinder development
- Unit tests and E2E tests should run in CI
- Test database schemas should match up with production database schema
- Have integration tests which test from the PostgreSQL database to API Gateway

## Data Migrations
### A good data migration
- Record failure logs
- Automated
- Reliable
- As close to real time as possible
- Observable monitoring in place
- Should not affect any existing databases
